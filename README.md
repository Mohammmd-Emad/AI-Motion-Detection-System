# AI Motion Detection System  

## üìå Overview  
This project was developed for the **AI Motion Sensor Competition**, organized by **IEEE ComSoc and MathWorks**.  

We built a **real-time human activity recognition system** using smartphone sensor data (accelerometer & gyroscope).  
The system detects activities such as **Sitting, Standing, Walking, and Lying Down** in real time and visualizes them on a **Flask web application** with a live dashboard.

## üéØ Project Workflow  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Collection  
- Data was recorded using the **Phyphox app** on a smartphone.  
- Activities captured: Sitting, Standing, Walking, Lying down.  
- Each activity recorded for ~10 minutes.  
- Sensors used: **Accelerometer + Gyroscope**.  

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Feature Extraction  
- Sliding window approach (100 samples per window, 50% overlap).  
- Extracted **30 statistical features** (mean, std, min, max, energy) from each window.  
- Tools used: **Python, Pandas, NumPy**.  

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Model Training  
- Trained a **Random Forest Classifier**.  
- Achieved **99.7% accuracy** with strong precision, recall, and F1-score.  
- Model saved using **joblib** for deployment.  

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Flask Web Application  
- **Backend (Flask/Python)**: real-time data fetching, feature extraction, ML prediction.  
- **Frontend (HTML/CSS/JS)**: responsive dashboard with live updates.  
- **Features**:  
  - Real-time prediction of current activity  
  - Last-hour and daily activity reports  
  - Goal tracking (e.g., daily walking goal)  

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Testing  
- System tested in real-time with Phyphox streaming data.  
- Predictions updated every ~2 seconds.  
- Smooth performance (<100ms processing per prediction).
